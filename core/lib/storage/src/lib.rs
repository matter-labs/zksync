//! Storage crate provides the interfaces to interact with the database.
//! The backend database used in this crate is `Postgres`, and interaction
//! with it is based on the `sqlx` crate.
//!
//! The essential structure of this crate is the `StorageProcessor`, which
//! holds down the connection to the database and provides abstract interfaces
//! to modify it (called `Schema`s).
//!
//! # Crate Architecture Overview
//!
//! This crate can be divided into three logical parts:
//! - Connection utilities. Tools to establish connections to the database,
//!   stored in the `connection` module.
//! - `Schema`s. Schema is a logically extracted access to the part of
//!   the database, e.g. `ethereum` (which contains methods to store the
//!   information about interaction with the Ethereum blockchain).
//! - `StorageProcessor`. A structure that connects the two points above
//!   into one user-friendly interface.
//!
//! Most of schema modules contain at least two files:
//! - `mod.rs`, which contains the schema itself.
//! - `records.rs`, which contains the representation of the associated database
//!   tables as structures.
//!
//! The latter ones usually don't contain any logic other than the structures
//! declarations, and all the logic is contained in either schema (for most
//! modules), or in an additional helper module (e.g. in the `chain/block` module).
//!
//! # Schema Hierarchy
//!
//! There are the following sets of schemas:
//!
//! - config, for the server config.
//! - data_restore, for the data_restore crate.
//! - ethereum, for the data associated with the Ethereum blockchain.
//! - prover, for the data on prover jobs, proofs, etc.
//! - tokens, for storing and loading known tokens.
//! - chain - the biggest one, which includes several schemas for the ZKSync sidechain itself.
//!
//! The chain module includes the following schemas:
//!
//! - account, for storing and loading account data.
//! - block, the main one, which implements the logic of the block creation.
//! - operations, the transactions storage.
//! - operations_ext, a set of getters for the operations, more specific and convenient to use than operations has.
//! - state, basically the sidechain state manager (which includes the applying of the state changes).
//! - stats, other auxiliary schema which provides additional getters for the database stats.
//!
//! If you have to add a method, and can't decide which schema it belongs to, use the following logic:
//!
//! 1. Will your method be used by different modules? If no (e.g. it'll be only used by `eth_sender` or `data_restore`),
//!    then mind adding method to high-level schema (you may even create a new one, if it makes sense).
//!    If yes, probably it affects the sidechain state, and you should choose one of the `chain` schemas.
//! 2. Will your method be used by other schemas? If yes, choose one of the "low-level" schemas, like `operations,
//!    or `account`.
//! 3. Is your method is some form of convenient getter? If so, `operations_ext` may be suitable.
//! 4. Otherwise, it probably should be in `block` (for high-level interaction), `state` (for ZKSync tables update that
//!    are not low-level enough for other modules), or a new schema (if none of existing ones fit your needs).
//!
//! # Testing Approach
//!
//! Tests for the storage use the actual empty Postgres database.
//! Because of that, these tests are disabled by default, to run them you must use
//! `zk test db` (or `zk test db --no-reset`, if this is not a first run)
//! command, which will setup the database and enable the tests by passing a feature flag.
//!
//! Tests are implemented in a form of "test transactions", which are database transactions
//! that will never be committed. Thus it is not required to clear the database after running
//! tests. Also the database used for tests is different than the database used for `server`,
//! thus one should not fear to overwrite any important data by running the tests.

// `sqlx` macros result in these warning being triggered.
