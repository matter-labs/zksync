    // transactions one by one) but doing this in one method gives us simplicity and atomicity of our deployment.

    // If we use selfdesctruction in the constructor then it removes overhead of deploying Proxy and UpgradeGatekeeper
    // with DeployFactory and in total this constructor would cost us around 3.5kk, so we got simplicity and atomicity of
    // deploy without overhead.

    // `_feeAccountAddress` argument is not used by the constructor itself, but it's important to have this
    // information as a part of a transaction, since this transaction can be used for restoring the tree
    // state. By including this address to the list of arguments, we're making ourselves able to restore
    // genesis state, as the very first account in tree is a fee account, and we need its address before
    // we're able to start recovering the data from the Ethereum blockchain.
