# Core Components Changelog

All notable changes to the core components will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Removed

- (`api_server`): REST API v1.0.

### Changed

- (`loadtest`): `zksync_fee` has been moved to `[main_wallet]` section from the `[network]` section.
- (`EthWatcher`): added processing of events about adding new tokens to the contract.
- A special balancer for FeeTicker was replaced with a generic balancer.
- (`eth_client`): `web3` field was made private in `ETHDirectClient`. `testkit` and `loadtest` don't use it directly
  now.
- (`api_server`): Make `submit_txs_batch` send only one signature request.
- Fast withdrawals now can trigger aggregated block execution.
- Replaced `anyhow` errors with typed errors in `lib/state`, `lib/crypto` and `lib/types`.
- (`fee-ticker`): Batch fee now includes `zkp_fee` and `gas_fee`.

### Added

- (`loadtest`): Added `zksync_fee` option into the `[scenario]` section to set fee for each scenario individually, added
  `fee_token` option into the `[main_wallet]` section to set token that is used to pay fees for the main wallet
  operations.
- (`TokenHandler`): Module for automatically adding a token to the database based on the received Ethereum event
  (`NewTokenEvent`).
- (`Notifier`): Module for sending notifications to third-party services.
- (`eth_client`): Added `get_tx`, `create_contract` methods to `EthereumGateway`, `get_web3_transport` method to
  ETHDirectClient.
- (`api_server`): Support for accounts that don't have to pay fees (e.g. network service accounts) was added.
- Added `BlockMetadata` structure and corresponding table to track block data that is not related to protocol.
- (`block_revert`): CLI that calls `revertBlocks` smart contract function and updates the database respectively.
- (`api_server`): Added REST API v0.2.
- (`api_client`): Client for REST API v0.2.
- (`api_types`): Crate for storing types that are used in API.
- Added hashes for batches and additional hashes for priority operations.
- Added `ForcedExit` fee type to REST API v0.2 and JSON RPC API.

### Fixed

- (`zksync_api`): Internal error with tokens not listed on CoinGecko.
- Fix wrong block info cache behavior in the `api_server`.
- Bug with gas price limit being used instead of average gas price when storing data to DB in gas adjuster.
- `timeout` in ETH sender main loop was replaced with `tokio::time::delay_for`.

## Release 2021-02-19

### Removed

### Changed

- The token name is now set for each scenario separately instead of the network section of the loadtest configuration.
- Rejected transactions are now stored in the database for 2 weeks only.

### Added

- Added a stressing dev fee ticker scenario to the loadtest.
- Added a `--sloppy` mode to the `dev-fee-ticker-server` to simulate bad networks with the random delays and fails.
- Added `forced_exit_requests` functionality, which allows users to pay for ForcedExits from L1. Note that a few env
  variables were added that control the behaviour of the tool.
- Possibility to use CREATE2 ChangePubKey and Transfer in a single batch.

### Fixed

- Bug with the assignment of new account ids in the state.

## Release 2021-02-02

### Removed

- `MetricsCounter` structure was removed because it is not used.
- The limit on the number of withdrawals in the block.

### Changed

- Type aliases (`TokenId`, `AccountId`, `Nonce`, `BlockNumber`, `PriorityOpId`, `EthBlockId`) are replaced with wrapper
  structures.
- `prometheus_exporter` was made a library to be used by several crates.
- `prover_run_for_next_commit` function uses a parameterized timeout instead of a hard-coded one.
- (`storage`): `action_type` column type in db is changed from `text` to `enum` for optimization.
- (`FeeTicker`): Increased gas price estimate for transaction.
- (`loadtest`): Scenario execution was made parallel.
- Increased completeWithdrawal gas limit, that decreased the chance of the users to face the out-of-gas error

### Added

- `prometheus_exporter` is launched by every microservice.
- `tokens_acceptable_for_fees` endpoint that returns the list of tokens acceptable for fees was added to REST API v0.1.

### Fixed

- (`FeeTicker`): Performance for getting the batch fee was heavily optimized.

## Release 2021-01-12

### Changed

- `gen_token_add_contract` crate is rewritten in ts.
- Metrics were added to some functions from lib/storage.
- `get_tx_by_hash` function was simplified.

### Added

- `closest_greater_or_eq_packable_fee_amount` and `closest_greater_or_eq_packable_token_amount` functions.
  `test_float_conversions` test was expanded.
- Loadtest scenario for stressing transaction batches

### Removed

- Sequential Sparse Merkle Tree implementation was removed because it has been replaced by the parallel implementation.

### Fixed

- Bug with `to_float` function. Now, it really rounds to the closest less or equal float number.
- Wrong index type used in the database causing some queries to take too much time.

## Prior to 2020-12-23
